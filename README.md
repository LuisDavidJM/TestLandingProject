## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the page regardless of the device that is used
- See a blur in the image when they are outside of it
- See a template of a services page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned to place a background image of the entire screen, to which a blur is applied using the CSS focus and move, in addition to implementing the CSS Grid to make a service template.

### Continued development

Integrate more service sections and make some animations to make it more visually appealing.
